This information is for people who wish to transfer their tickets for the upcoming PyData Delhi 2017.

If you are not able to attend the conference for any reason, and wish to transfer your ticket to a friend or anyone else from the community, you can send us an [email](mailto:pydatadelhi@gmail.com) **before August 30** to `pydatadelhi@gmail.com` with the subject `Ticket transfer`, attaching your original ticket and the following information of the person to which you want to transfer the ticket (Y):

- Name:

Also ask the other person to pay you the amount of the ticket + taxes you paid us, and send us the screenshot for the same. You can figure this out using one of the multiple payment options available (BHIM/Paytm/Mobikwik etc ..)

After getting all these details, we'll transfer the ticket from our system, and send both of you (X, Y) a confirmation email.

If you are not able to find a person to transfer the ticket, just ask in the community group on Telegram and you will find many people seeking a ticket.
